In this project, my main goal was to create a personal portfolio webpage (placeholder text and images) that almost identically resembled the previous one that I made, only this time it would be primarily styled with Bootstrap and be fully responsive to any screen size. This project helped me get a feel for just how powerful and efficient Bootstrap can be, especially when it comes to responsive layouts. It certainly took a bit of getting used to, but once I got the hang of it, it became a much quicker process than writing up all of thee CSS on my own. Not having to worry about the nuances of manually inputting media queries was also a pretty big plus. I used material that I learned in class as well as outside resources to help me put this project together.
